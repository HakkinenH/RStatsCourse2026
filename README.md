# Statistics in R Course 2026
Introduction to Statistics at ZSL

As part of IoZ’s core training programme, course materials for IoZ training on the 4th and 5th of February! 

Course is split into two parts, the first is for complete beginners (or those who want to fill in any gaps in basic theory and understanding) and the second will build up to more intermediate-level analyses.

As a rough guide, the course focusses on the following in Part 1:
•	The purpose and basic principles of statistics
•	Understanding data and the process of selecting a statistical test
•	The theory and practice of simple tests (including Chi-Squared, t-tests, simple correlations, linear models)
•	Running and checking assumptions of a given test
•	Interpreting output of a statistical test (p-values, parameter estimates, r-squared etc.)
•	Common sense and how to use it in statistics
Part 2 will build on the above:
•	Expanding our statistical toolkit (Generalised Linear Models to analyse binary, count, proportional data etc.)
•	Model fitting and model selection
•	What are random effects and when do we use them
•	Problem solving, and what to do with messy, unusual data
•	Frequentist inference, its strengths and limitations
•	Expanding horizons, and learning not to fear the unknown


All exercises are in R and RStudio

NOTE:
Always run 0Packages.R first, it installs all dependencies needed for this course
After that, files can be approached in any order
